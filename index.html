              <p>From a recent guest:
                <i>
                  "The Dragonview was perfect for the reunion of 4 couples.
                  It had everything we needed to enjoy our time together and visit in Bisbee.
                  Each bedroom has a very comfortable bed and access to a private patio
                  with wonderful views of Bisbee. The spacious kitchen with its large wrap
                  around counter open to the living and dining room was ideal for being together.
                  We enjoyed barbecuing and conversations in the front patio. The home has a unique
                  private location yet is close to downtown. We also appreciated the lovely way
                  the home was decorated with artwork and treasures collected from travels around
                  the world, and so impeccably clean. The owners have thought of everything to
                  make the Dragonview Retreat the perfect place to stay!"</i>
